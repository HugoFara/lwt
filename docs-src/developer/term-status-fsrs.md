# Proposal: Term Status Model + FSRS Scheduling

**Status:** **Phase 1 and phase 2a implemented** (#238). Phase 2b (retiring the
legacy Leitner scoring and switching the review queue over) remains proposed.
Tracked in [issue #238](https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues/238).

The three open product questions have been decided — see
[Decisions taken](#decisions-taken). Phase 2 was split in two so the
irreversible part (dropping the old score columns) is a separate, later step
from the additive part (accumulating FSRS state).

## Problem

The word-status model — `1-5` (learning), `98` (ignored), `99` (well-known) — is the
spine of both the reading UI (word colouring) and the review system, yet it is
modelled ad-hoc:

- **Duplicated everywhere.** The literal `[1,2,3,4,5,98,99]` and checks like
  `$status === 5 || $status === 99` ("known") recur across **11+ PHP files**
  (`WordFamilyService`, `StatusHelper`, `ReviewApiHandler`, `MySqlStatisticsRepository`,
  `SubmitAnswer`…). Label/colour/order/CSS tables are **re-defined in ~6 TS files**
  (`word_popover.ts`, `term_edit_modal.ts`, `text_status_chart.ts`,
  `texts_grouped_app.ts`, `html_utils.ts`, `statistics_charts.ts`). A
  `TermStatus` value object already exists
  (`src/Modules/Vocabulary/Domain/ValueObject/TermStatus.php`) but is not the single
  source of truth.
- **Scheduling is a hand-tuned Leitner curve.** "Due-ness" comes from
  `TermStatusService::SCORE_FORMULA_TODAY/TOMORROW`: a per-status linear decay
  (`base(status) − decay(status) × days_since_status_change`, clamped at −125, status
  > 5 ⇒ 100) stored in `WoTodayScore`/`WoTomorrowScore`, shuffled by `WoRandom`. The
  status *is* the box; a review just nudges status ±1
  (`SubmitAnswer::executeWithChange`). There is no real memory model, no per-term
  difficulty, no retention target, and no review history.

So two distinct concerns are conflated in one integer: **how familiar a word is**
(needed by the reading view) and **when it should next be reviewed** (scheduling).

## Goal

1. **Make the status model a single source of truth** (foundational, low-risk).
2. **Align scheduling with Anki/FSRS** by separating *display familiarity* from
   *memory state*, replacing the Leitner score formulas with a principled scheduler.

## Phase 1 — Status as a single source of truth ✅ implemented

This stands alone and was worth doing regardless of Phase 2.

### What shipped

- **`TermStatus` is now the authoritative model.** It holds the abbreviation, CSS
  class, light-theme colour, order and predicates, and exposes
  `TermStatus::definitions()` — the single ordered table of `value / name / abbr /
  cssClass / colour / order / isKnown / isLearning / isIgnored`. `isValid()`,
  `values()` and `isKnownValue()/isIgnoredValue()/isLearningValue()` (non-throwing,
  safe on unvalidated input) round it out.
- **`TermStatusService` and `StatusHelper` delegate to the VO.** `getStatuses()`,
  `getStatusColor()`, `isValidStatus()` and the `is{Learning,Known,Ignored}Status()`
  helpers are now thin adapters; the duplicated name/abbr/colour tables are gone.
  (The scheduling members — `SCORE_FORMULA_*`, `calculateScore()`,
  `makeScoreRandomInsertUpdate()` — were left untouched; they are Phase 2.)
- **The scattered literals are gone.** `in_array($status, [1,2,3,4,5,98,99])`,
  `array_fill_keys([1,2,3,4,5,98,99], …)` and `=== 5 || === 99` / `=== 98` checks
  across the Review, Vocabulary and Admin modules now call `TermStatus::isValid()`,
  `TermStatus::values()` and `isKnownValue()/isIgnoredValue()`.
- **Exposed once to the frontend** via `GET /api/v1/settings/status-definitions`
  (returns `TermStatus::definitions()`).
- **One frontend store.** `shared/stores/statuses.ts` is the single TS source for
  status labels/abbr/order/class (localized through the shared `common.status_*`
  i18n keys, so PHP and TS resolve identical text). The duplicated `STATUS_LABELS` /
  `STATUS_ORDER` tables in `text_status_chart.ts`, `texts_grouped_app.ts` and
  `html_utils.ts`, the `term_edit_modal.ts` option list, and the `app_data.ts`
  `statuses` proxy now all resolve from it.

### Deliberately left for a follow-up

- The two Chart.js **colour palettes** (`statistics_charts.ts`,
  `text_status_chart.ts`) diverge from each other and from the CSS
  `--lwt-status*` variables; unifying them is a *visual* change, kept out of this
  cleanup. The reading view itself already single-sources its colours from CSS.
- `word_popover.ts` / `multi_word_modal.ts` keep their local status lists — those
  encode popover-specific *presentation* (Bulma button colours, short `Known` /
  `Ignore` badges) rather than the status model.

## Phase 2 — FSRS-aligned scheduling

### The core idea: split the two concerns

| Concern | Today | Proposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Display familiarity** (reading colours) | `WoStatus` 1–5/98/99 | keep 1–5/98/99 — but *derive* 1–5 from memory strength |
| **Scheduling** (when to review) | per-status decay score | FSRS memory state per term |

Anki/FSRS models each item's memory with three quantities:

- **Stability (S)** — days for retrievability to fall to 90%.
- **Difficulty (D)** — how hard the item is (≈1–10).
- **Retrievability (R)** — current recall probability, from the power forgetting
  curve `R(t) = (1 + F · t/S)^D_curve` (constants `F`, `D_curve` come from the FSRS
  spec/optimizer). The item becomes due when `R` drops to a **target retention**
  (default 0.9).

Reviews are graded on **4 buttons** — Again / Hard / Good / Easy — and each grade
updates `S` and `D` via the FSRS update functions, yielding the next due date.

### What changes

1. **Schema** — add per-term scheduling state (new columns or a `term_schedule`
   table keyed by `WoID`): `stability`, `difficulty`, `due`, `last_review`, `reps`,
   `lapses`, `state` (new/learning/review/relearning). Retire
   `WoTodayScore`/`WoTomorrowScore`/`WoRandom` and the SQL score formulas.
2. **A `Scheduler` service** (in `Modules/Review`) implementing the FSRS update +
   next-interval computation, behind an interface so the algorithm is swappable
   (FSRS now, room for SM-2/custom later). The open-source FSRS reference
   (`open-spaced-repetition`, permissively licensed) is ~a few hundred lines to port;
   verify whether a maintained PHP port can be vendored instead of hand-porting.
3. **Review UX** — the binary correct/incorrect (± 1 status) becomes the 4-grade
   rating. `SubmitAnswer` calls the scheduler instead of `calculateNewStatus`.
4. **`review_log` table** — record `(WoID, grade, state, S, D, elapsed, reviewed_at)`
   per review. FSRS can schedule from current state alone, but logs are required to
   later **optimise** the FSRS parameters per user (Anki's "FSRS optimizer").
5. **Derive display status from stability** — bucket `S` into the familiar 1–5 tiers
   (e.g. `S<1d⇒1`, `<7d⇒2`, `<30d⇒3`, `<90d⇒4`, `≥90d⇒5`) so reading colours reflect
   real memory strength. `98`/`99` stay manual flags meaning "ignored" / "known, not
   scheduled" (≈ Anki suspended). Keep a manual status override that seeds `S`/`D`.

### Migration / continuity

Existing terms have only `WoStatus` + `WoStatusChanged`. Seed FSRS state from them:
map each status to a starting `S` (reuse the current per-status intervals as the
seed), set a default `D`, and `last_review = WoStatusChanged`. No review history is
lost because there is none today; the `review_log` starts accumulating from rollout.

## Decisions taken

The three questions this proposal was gated on, and how they were resolved.

### 1. Display status stays **manual**, not derived from stability

The original recommendation was to derive the 1–5 reading colours from FSRS
stability. That was rejected: it imports an Anki assumption that does not hold
here. **In Anki every card is reviewed; in LWT review is optional and reading is
the primary loop.** Many users never open the review page — they read, click
words, and set status by hand.

Deriving status from stability would give those users reading colours that drift
on their own, driven by a scheduler they do not use: a word deliberately marked
5 decays to 3 because it was never reviewed. That is a regression in the core
experience.

So `WoStatus` remains manual and authoritative for display, and FSRS state is
purely additive. This also removes the migration's biggest risk for free —
"reading-view colours are unchanged after upgrading" is true by construction
rather than something to verify. A derived-status mode can be added later as an
opt-in setting.

### 2. **Four grades**, no 2-button mode

Hard and Easy are where FSRS gets the information that makes it beat SM-2; a
2-button mode degrades it to roughly the Leitner behaviour we already have.
The legacy binary answer maps to Again/Good (`Rating::fromBinary()`), so old
callers keep working without a separate mode to maintain.

### 3. **Hand-port**, not a vendored dependency

Neither PHP option was viable:

- [`fsrs-rs-php`](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs-rs-php), the
  official binding, requires compiling a Rust PHP extension — manual `.so`
  copy, `php.ini` edit, no Composer install. Disqualifying for a self-hosting
  audience; LWT already had to fix Windows CI for a *bundled* extension
  (`pdo_sqlite`, #259).
- [`scottlaurent/fsrs`](https://packagist.org/packages/scottlaurent/fsrs) is
  pure PHP and MIT, but v0.1 / one commit / no validation against reference
  vectors, and declares PHP 8.1–8.3 against LWT's 8.2–8.5.

`Fsrs6Scheduler` is therefore a hand-port of
[py-fsrs](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrs) **v6.3.1**,
validated against vectors generated from that exact release (see
[Verification](#verification)). LWT is public-domain under the Unlicense; that
one file carries the reference implementation's MIT notice, as the licence
requires.

::: warning Pin the reference version
py-fsrs's unreleased `main` widens the short-term stability clamp from
`(Good, Easy)` to `(Hard, Good, Easy)`. That materially changes same-day
repeats — a same-day Hard becomes a no-op instead of a ~44% stability cut. The
port follows released **v6.3.1**. Retarget it only together with regenerated
fixtures.
:::

## Phase 2a — additive FSRS state ✅ implemented

Everything below accumulates FSRS data on real reviews **without changing what
users see**. The legacy scoring keeps running untouched, so the two models can
be compared on real data before anything is retired.

- **Two new tables** (`db/migrations/20260805_200000_add_fsrs_scheduling.sql`):
  `term_schedule` (stability, difficulty, due, last review, reps, lapses, state)
  and the append-only `review_log`. `TsState` values match Anki's `cards.type`
  so the `.apkg` exporter can write them straight through later.
- **`Fsrs6Scheduler`** behind `SchedulerInterface`, with `FsrsParameters`
  (21 weights, target retention, maximum interval) — swappable by design.
- **Lazy seeding.** `LegacyStatusSeed` maps each legacy status to the stability
  that reproduces its Leitner interval (1/2/9/27/71 days for statuses 1–5), with
  `lastReview = WoStatusChanged`. Rows appear on a term's first graded review
  rather than via a bulk backfill, so a 100k-term vocabulary costs nothing at
  upgrade time and nobody's queue floods. 98/99 are never scheduled.
- **`RecordScheduledReview`** is called from `SubmitAnswer` as a *shadow write*:
  it runs only after the legacy update succeeds, and swallows storage errors so
  a scheduling failure can never break the review the user just submitted.
- **`SubmitAnswer::executeWithGrade()`** is the FSRS-native entry point; the
  grade also drives the legacy ±1 status nudge, so reading behaviour is
  identical whichever endpoint is used.

**Not in 2a:** nothing reads `term_schedule` to choose review words yet, there
is no 4-grade UI, and interval fuzzing and the parameter optimiser are omitted
(fuzzing only exists to spread Anki's daily load; the optimiser needs
accumulated history).

## Phase 2b — retire the legacy scoring (in progress)

**Shipped so far:**

- **The queue reads the schedule.** `ScheduleSql` supplies a term's due date to
  next-word, the due and tomorrow counts, and the table listing, replacing
  `WoTodayScore < 0` / `WoTomorrowScore < 0` / `ORDER BY WoTodayScore, WoRandom`.
  Rows are seeded lazily, so a term without one falls back to the date
  `LegacyStatusSeed` would have given it and the queue is unchanged on upgrade.
  That reproduces the old test to within a day: the legacy formula rounded
  before comparing, which put status 2 at day 3 (interval 2) and status 5 at day
  72 (71). The two-pass `WoRandom` sampling is gone with it.
- **The 4-grade UI.** `PUT /review/status` takes a `grade`, `GET
  /review/intervals` previews what each grade would schedule, and the review
  card shows four buttons with their intervals. Keys 1-4 grade (read off
  `e.code`, so layouts where digits are shifted behave the same); setting a
  status directly moved to Shift+1-5.

**Found on the way:** the 2a shadow write was never firing from the review SPA.
It lives in `SubmitAnswer::executeWithChange()`, but the client computed the new
status itself and sent that, which routes through `execute()` — no scheduling
write. So `term_schedule` stayed empty on installs that only ever used the main
review screen. The graded path fixes this for the SPA; the binary `change`
endpoint was always fine.

- **Scheduling reaches Anki.** The `.apkg` exporter writes a scheduled term as
  a review card — `type`/`queue` 2, due in days from the collection creation
  day, interval, reps and lapses — with the FSRS memory state in `cards.data`
  as `{"s":…,"d":…,"dr":…}` and its history as `revlog` rows. Grades pass
  through unchanged, both apps numbering Again..Easy 1–4. Suspension still wins
  the queue but no longer discards the state. Relearning is flattened to review
  (Anki keys learning-queue due dates by timestamp, not day number) and the
  ease factor is Anki's default 2500, since LWT has never computed an SM-2
  ease and 0 would collapse the interval for anyone with FSRS off.

- **The legacy scoring is retired.** `SCORE_FORMULA_*`,
  `makeScoreRandomInsertUpdate()` and the three columns are gone, along with
  the daily UPDATE across the whole `words` table that kept them fresh. The
  scope was larger than this document claimed: sixteen files reference the
  columns directly, but the SQL-fragment builder had **37** call sites across
  fifteen more. `ReviewService` — 847 lines duplicating the queue with no
  caller — was deleted rather than migrated.

**Still unverified:** the .apkg export has been read back with SQLite and
matches what Anki documents, but nobody has yet opened one of these decks in a
real Anki install.

## Trade-offs & open questions

The three gating questions are resolved in [Decisions taken](#decisions-taken).
What remains open, all deferred to phase 2b or later:

- **Per-user vs. global parameters.** FSRS ships sensible defaults; per-user
  optimisation needs enough `review_log` history and an optimiser job. 2a starts
  accumulating that history — revisit once real data exists.
- **Interval fuzzing.** Omitted deliberately. It exists to spread Anki's daily
  review load; whether LWT wants it depends on how the 2b queue behaves.
- **Seed quality.** The status→stability mapping reproduces the *legacy*
  intervals, which were hand-tuned rather than fitted. Once `review_log` has
  data, check whether seeded terms behave sensibly or whether the mapping should
  be re-derived.
- **Scope of 2b.** Retiring the score columns touches 16 PHP files, the review
  UI, and stats. Sequence it after 2a has proven itself.

## Scope sketch (when picked up)

- **Phase 1:** `TermStatus` VO (expand), `TermStatusService` + `StatusHelper`
  (fold in), ~11 PHP call sites (adopt VO), status-definitions API + bootstrap, ~6 TS
  files → `shared/stores/statuses.ts`.
- **Phase 2a (done):** migration (`term_schedule` + `review_log`),
  `SchedulerInterface` + `Fsrs6Scheduler` + `FsrsParameters`, `LegacyStatusSeed`,
  `MySqlTermScheduleRepository`, `RecordScheduledReview`, and the shadow-write
  hook in `SubmitAnswer`.
- **Phase 2b:** review UI (4-grade), review queue ordered by `TsDue`, stats that
  read `WoTodayScore` → read `TsDue`, removal of `SCORE_FORMULA_*` /
  `WoTodayScore` / `WoTomorrowScore` / `WoRandom` across their 16 call sites,
  and `cards.data` + `revlog` in the `.apkg` exporter (#228).

## Verification

**Done for phase 2a:**

1. **Reference vectors.** `Fsrs6SchedulerTest` replays 7 review sequences (24
   graded reviews) generated from py-fsrs v6.3.1, asserting stability,
   difficulty, retrievability and interval at every step to 1e-9. The fixture
   and its generator live in
   `tests/backend/Modules/Review/Domain/Scheduling/fixtures/`. Regenerate with:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ./.venv/bin/pip install 'fsrs==6.3.1'
   ./.venv/bin/python generate_reference_vectors.py > fsrs6_reference_vectors.json
   ```

   These vectors already caught one real porting bug (the short-term clamp
   described above), which is exactly what they are for.

2. **Property tests** alongside them: difficulty saturates within [1, 10] under
   40 consecutive Again and 40 consecutive Easy; a lapse never increases
   stability; Hard < Good < Easy intervals from identical state; retrievability
   is exactly 0.9 after one stability period; a stricter retention target
   schedules sooner.

3. **Integration** (`TermScheduleRepositoryIntegrationTest`, real MySQL): lazy
   seeding from each status, state upsert vs. append-only log, lapse counting,
   due counting, and null for unowned/missing terms.

4. **Gates:** psalm 0 errors, phpcs PSR12 clean, full PHPUnit suite green.

**Still to do for phase 2b:** E2E through a real review session across all four
grades, and confirmation that reading-view colours are untouched on a populated
upgrade (true by construction under decision 1, but worth seeing).
