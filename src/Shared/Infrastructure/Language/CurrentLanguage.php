/**
 * Resolves the language the user is currently working in.
 *
 * The `currentlanguage` setting is only written when the user actively picks a
 * language from the navbar dropdown. Two situations leave it unset or stale, and
 * both used to surface as "no language selected" even though the navbar showed
 * one:
 *
 * - A user who has just created their first language has never fired the
 *   dropdown's `change` event. With exactly one language there is no other
 *   option to switch to, so the event can never fire and the setting can never
 *   be written — the install is stuck in that state permanently.
 * - The setting can point at a language that has since been deleted.
 *
 * In both cases the navbar still *looked* right: it renders a `<select>` and
 * marks an option `selected` only when the id matches, so with no match the
 * browser falls back to displaying the first option. The display and the stored
 * state disagreed, and every server-side consumer read 0.
 *
 * This resolver is the single answer to "which language is active?". It is
 * read-only on purpose: it never writes the setting, so a plain GET has no side
 * effects and the same request always resolves the same way.
 *
 * Callers that need the id to agree with what the navbar displays must use this
 * rather than reading the setting directly — the fallback ordering here matches
 * the navbar's (`LgName`, skipping unnamed rows).
