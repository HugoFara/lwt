## Preface

*   ****THIS IS A THIRD PARTY VERSION - IT DIFFERS IN MANY RESPECTS FROM THE OFFICIAL LWT-VERSION (more [here](#new_features))****
*   I started this software application in 2010 as a hobby project for my personal learning (reading & listening to foreign texts, saving & reviewing new words and expressions).
*   In June 2011, I decided to publish the software in the hope that it will be useful to other language learners around the world.
*   The software is 100 % free, open source, and in the public domain. You may do with it what you like: use it, improve it, change it, publish an improved version, even use it within a commercial product.
*   English is not my mother tongue - so please forgive me any mistakes.
*   A piece of software will be never completely free of "bugs" - please inform me of any problem you will encounter. Your feedback and ideas are always welcome.
*   My programming style is quite chaotic, and my software is mostly undocumented. This will annoy people with much better programming habits than mine, but please bear in mind that LWT is a one-man hobby project and completely free.
*   Thank you for your attention. I hope you will enjoy this application as I do every day.
