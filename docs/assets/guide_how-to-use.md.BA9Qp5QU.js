To find the language codes, open <a href="http://glosbe.com/all-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this page</a> to select the &quot;from&quot; (L2) language. On the next page, select the &quot;L2 - L1&quot; language pair. The URL of the next page shows the two language codes, here as an example &quot;French - English&quot;: http://glosbe.com/<strong>fr</strong>/<strong>en</strong>/. The &quot;from&quot; code is &quot;fr&quot;, the &quot;dest&quot; code is &quot;en&quot;. Using this dictionary makes the transfer of translation(s) from the Glosbe to LWT very easy: just click on the icon next to the translations to copy them into the LWT edit screen. I recommend to use the LWT-integrated Glosbe dictionary as the &quot;Dictionary 1 URI&quot;. Note: I cannot guarantee that the Glosbe API and this special integration will work in the future! glosbe_api.php is just an example how one can integrate a dictionary into LWT.</p><p>You don&#39;t know how and where to find a good web dictionary?

The &quot;from&quot; character is replaced by the &quot;to&quot; character (&quot;to&quot; may be also empty). So different kinds of apostrophes can unified or deleted.</p><p>&quot;RegExp Split Sentences&quot; is a list of characters that signify a sentence ending (ALWAYS together with a following space or newline!).

Some parts of this string are placeholders that are replaced by the actual term data, <a href="./export_template.html">see this table</a>. For each term (word or expression), that has been selected for export, the placeholders of the export template will be replaced by the term data and the string will be written to the export file.

An audio URI and a link to the text source can also be defined. The best place to store your audios is the &quot;media&quot; subdirectory below the installation directory &quot;lwt&quot; (you have to create it yourself, and you have to copy the audio files into this directory; click Refresh if you don&#39;t see just copied media). But a cloud webspace service like DropBox is also possible. In the moment there is no possibility to import/upload an audio file within the LWT application. By the way, you can use MP3, WAV, or OGG media files, but be aware that not all browsers and/or operating systems support all media types!</p><p>If you click &quot;Check&quot;, the text will be parsed and split into sentences and words according to your language settings. Nothing will be stored if you check a text. You can see whether your text needs some editing, or whether your language settings (especially the ones that influence parsing/splitting) need an adjustment. Words (not expressions) that are already in your word list are displayed in red, and the translation is displayed. The Non-Word List shows all stuff between words. The &quot;Check a Text&quot; function can also be started directly from the main menu. If you click on &quot;Change&quot; or &quot;Save&quot;, the text will be only saved.

One example are the word-by-word translations in <a href="http://en.assimil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Assimil</a> courses. The German <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070223080453/http://195.149.74.241/BIRKENBIHL/PDF/MethodEnglish.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">V. F. Birkenbihl</a> proposes the creation of interlinear word-by-word or <a href="http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperliteral_translations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hyperliteral</a> translations (calling this creation &quot;decoding&quot;) in foreign language learning. Learning Latin or Ancient Greek via interlinear texts is quite old as you can see in &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnEKnezLXJg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">014 Latin Interlinear Texts - a forgotten route to language learning.avi</a>&quot;.</p><p>LWT&#39;s old &quot;Print Screen&quot; offers annotations, but it displays ALL translations of a term. The <em>Improved Annotated Text</em> feature enables you to select the best translation for every word in the text. As a result, you create an L1 word-by-word translation that is displayed above the L2 text. This interlinear text is better suited for language study, especially for beginners.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> While listening to the audio, first follow the blue annotations in your native language while listening and understanding. Later, after understanding the text fully, you read the foreign language text alone. Repeat this often. After these steps, you listen to the text passively or do shadowing.</p><p>On the Print Screen, click on &quot;Create&quot; an Improved Annotated Text. The system creates a default annotated text.</p><h3 id="edit-mode" tabindex="-1">Edit Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#edit-mode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Edit Mode&quot;">​</a></h3><p><img src="'+S+'" alt="Image"></p><p>Within the &quot;Improved Annotated Text - Edit Mode&quot;, you can select the best term translation by clicking on one of the radio buttons. To be able to do this, multiple translations must be delimited by one of the delimiters specified in the LWT Settings (currently: /;|). You can also type in a new translation into the text box at the end (this does not change your saved term translation), or you may change your term by clicking on the yellow icon or add a translation by clicking on the green &quot;+&quot; icon (this does change your saved term translation), and select it afterwards. The &quot;Star&quot; icon indicated that you want the term itself as annotation. <strong>Important:</strong> It&#39;s not possible to create new terms here - please do this in the &quot;Read text&quot; screen. Changing the language settings (e.g. the word characters) may have the effect that you have to start from scratch. The best time for the creation of an improved annotated text is after you have read the text completely and created all terms and expressions in the &quot;Read text&quot; screen.</p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you change the text, you will lose the saved improved annotated text! All changes in the Edit screen are saved automatically in the background!</p><p>To leave the Edit mode, click on &quot;Display/Print Mode&quot;. You may then print or display (with audio) the text, and work with the text online or offline.</p><h3 id="print-mode" tabindex="-1">Print Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#print-mode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Print Mode&quot;">​</a></h3><p><img src="'+R+'" alt="Image"></p><h3 id="display-mode" tabindex="-1">Display Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#display-mode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Display Mode&quot;">​</a></h3><p>With audio player in a separate window.
