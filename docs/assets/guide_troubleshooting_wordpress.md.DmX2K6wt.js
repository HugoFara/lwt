If you only log out via the links on the WordPress pages, you will still be able to use LWT until the browser is closed. If you want to log out from both WordPress and LWT, use the above link, or click on the link on the LWT home page!</li><li>If you delete a user, you must find out its user number (table &quot;wp_users&quot;). After deleting the user in WordPress, you can delete all LWT tables with table names beginning with the user number plus an underscore &quot;_&quot;. You can do this in phpMyAdmin.</li></ol>',8)])])}const b=t(a,[["render",n]]);export{c as __pageData,b as default};
