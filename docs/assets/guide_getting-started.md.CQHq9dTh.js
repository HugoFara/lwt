It is inspired by:</p><ul><li><a href="http://sdkrashen.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stephen Krashen&#39;s</a> principles in Second Language Acquisition,</li><li>Steve Kaufmann&#39;s <a href="http://lingq.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LingQ</a> System and</li><li>Ideas from Khatzumoto, published at <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&quot;AJATT - All Japanese All The Time&quot;</a>.</li></ul><p>You define languages you want to learn and import texts you want to use for learning. While listening to the optional audio, you read the text, save, review and test &quot;terms&quot; (words or multi word expressions, 2 to 9 words).</p><p>In new texts all your previously saved words and expressions are displayed according to their current learn statuses, tooltips show translations and romanizations (readings), editing, changing the status, dictionary lookup, etc. is just a click away.</p><p>Import of terms in TSV/CSV format, export in TSV format, and export to <a href="http://ankisrs.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anki</a> (prepared for cloze tests), are also possible.</p><h2 id="requirements" tabindex="-1">Requirements <a class="header-anchor" href="#requirements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Requirements&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To run LWT, you&#39;ll need:</p><ol><li><strong>A modern web browser</strong>.

An easy way to install a local web server are preconfigured packages like <ul><li><a href="http://www.easyphp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EasyPHP</a> or <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">XAMPP</a> (Windows), or</li><li><a href="http://mamp.info/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MAMP</a> (macOS), or</li><li>a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LAMP (Linux-Apache-MariaDB-PHP) server</a> (Linux).</li></ul></li><li><strong>The LWT Application</strong>.

Your feedback and ideas are always welcome.</li><li>My programming style is quite chaotic, and my software is mostly undocumented.

I felt that the core idea was very good, but its implementation seemed unadapted, and the code was quite obfuscated. While I do not have any official responsibility to LWT (we don&#39;t have any kind of official agreement with lang-learn-guy), I am the the <em>de facto</em> maintainer of the community version. I dedicated myself to the following points (see the <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/discussions/6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub post</a>):</p><ul><li>Make LWT Open Source: document and refactor code</li><li>Meet the HTML5 standards: the interface was relying on deprecated systems like frames, making it difficult to use on small screens.</li><li>Simplify users&#39; lives: avoid complex installation or procedures whenever possible.</li></ul><p>If you spot any problem, please post any <a href="https://github.com/HugoFara/lwt/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">issue on GitHub</a>, and we will look at it.</p><p>While work is not yet finished, I also aim to expand LWT:</p><ul><li>Better UI: custom themes and better default appearance</li><li>Better UX: as of today (2022), 60 % of the web is done through mobile devices. It means less content at once and more intuitive behaviors.</li><li>Sounds: language learning is not just language reading. <ul><li>Text-to-speech features.</li><li>Motivational sounds when testing terms to makes things more lively.</li></ul></li></ul><p>But there is much more! The community version of LWT is no longer the feat of one man, it belongs to everyone. As such, it gets well easier to implement new features, discuss and exchange code and ideas. I don&#39;t know if LWT contains <em>your</em> killer feature, but I can say that it <em>can be implemented</em> with this version. Enjoy!</p>',21)])])}const p=t(n,[["render",o]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
